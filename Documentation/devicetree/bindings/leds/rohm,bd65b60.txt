ROHM BD65B60 device tree bindings

BD65B60 is a white LED driver IC that integrates PWM
step-up DC/DC converter with boost-capability of up to
maximum 28.5V and current driver with drive capability of up
to 25mA(Typ.) maximum setting. Precise brightness can be
controlled at wide ranges through the external PWM pulse
input.

Ranges below noted as [a, b] are closed ranges between a and b, i.e. a
and b are included in the range.
